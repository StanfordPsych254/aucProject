### Replicating "What Is Typical Is Good: The Influence of Face Typicality on Perceived Trustworthiness (2015)"

Even though I do not have a particular research agenda, I am generally interested in gender issues in the workplace. Recently, a lot of the discussion in that topic has centered around implicit bias and I have participated in company-wide trainings that aim to increase awareness of the topic. The results of this experiment was very interesting to me because it could shed light on a new dimension of bias: attractiveness. This paper investigates how judgements of trustworthiness based on appearance peak around "typical" faces. The experiment in the paper that I aim to replicate is experiment 1.

#### Stimuli
The stimuli is a set of female faces, each is a composite of faces of pre-determined attractiveness (these exemplar faces represent the sampled population of the original study, which is mainly European and American). These are available from https://osf.io/nxrsj/.

#### Procedures
The procedure is simple: participants are first split into two conditions at random. Participants in the first condition are asked the judge the face on trustworthiness, while the latter are asked to judge on attractiveness. Both are judged on a 9-point scale. Partcipants rate the full set of 11 faces three times, in three blocks, in random order within each block. The complete participant instructions were also added to OSF.

#### Challenges
The participants of the original experiment were female university students from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, which the stimuli were created for. It might be challenging to find a similar group of users on Mechanical Turk to get the same statistical power. Even if we can, it is unclear if the experiment will translate cleanly to an online survey to produce similar results.
