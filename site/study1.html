  In this experiment you will be asked to record your first impression of faces.
  Many times we meet strangers for the first time and form our first impression
  based on their faces.  There are faces that look trustworthy and there are
  faces that look untrustworthy.  In this experiment different faces will be
  presented to you and you will be required to judge their trustworthiness level.
  Judgment will be done using a 1 (Definitely not trustworthy) to 9 (Definitely
  trustworthy) scale.
